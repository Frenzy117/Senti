"I'm extremely casual on the K Pop front, like I enjoyed Dynamite by BTS and maybe that Ice Cream song... but usually don't go out of my way to seek it out and I usually have no idea who's playing when I'm in a Korean restaurant. But this was a genuine bop and I'm going to have it on repeat. 

Also Latto is blowing up right now, I never thought I'd see so many women rappers excelling at once and I'm loving it.",0.936,0.197,0.029,0.774

"I feel like there were so many references. Like the lyrics and the music video are giving Michael Jackson, the Beatles, Taylor Swift.  I wonder if there’s any Korean artist references that I’m just not getting because I just don’t know.

Like Michael Jackson, this is totally the kind of music video he would make  

Then the Beatles literally have a song about eight days a week. Love you every day girl always on my mind. One thing I can say girl I love you all the time. Hold me love me hold me love me eight days a week. 

Then there’s a Afterglow, and the funeral imagery  on Taylor


I don’t love the K-pop industry and I just read a story about a guy that got addicted to pain medication and was forced on diet pills who had to sell his house and his parents house because of his drug addiction. So while this is such a great video and such a cute sassy little song. I wish I could get the negative part out of my head. Life ain’t perfect. Just get over it. but I just can’t. I don’t wanna watch anymore tragedies I feel like I’ve seen enough in the western industry. 

One day I’ll be a positive person !!!  Does anyone else’s mind work like this, where they’re like wow yay I love the music by like dark dark dark thoughts? Like this man is including death imagery but like there’s actually K-pop deaths every few months from idols K—-themselves so it’s just dark humor I guess. It must be so nice to just see a video and just go weeeee pretty colors. 

I guess an interesting thing is like the death metaphor of like all the dangerous things he’s doing like isn’t caused by climate change, except maybe  the storm? The storm is the thing that actually kills him in the end though before he comes back to life, right?

"He’s capable of more, we’ve seen it in his BTS career. As a big fan, I am a tiny bit scared all the specific colors we love in JK came more from the songwriters in the group, specifically RM, SUGA and Jhope, who all create with specific references and with a singular vision. JK was almost like their instrument. I don’t know if he even knows what he wants to express. I do have faith he’ll figure it out as he goes through this process without the other members.
