"I love BTS, and I really want to love JK‚Äôs solo work.

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad - just that it‚Äôs okay as it is forgettable. I know they‚Äôre adding features to expand the audience, but that will hardly have impact when the songs feel so generic. 3D especially sounds like what Starbucks food tastes like lol. 

I think they need to find JK‚Äôs producer - like Taylor‚Äôs Antonoff, or Billie‚Äôs Finneas. I‚Äôve heard the music JK likes and what he‚Äôs covered in the past - I‚Äôm surprised he isn‚Äôt going more that direction. 

Sorry, not trying to hate, I really want JK to succeed, but I have a hard time imagining his audience will grow much bigger in the US with these sounds. It‚Äôll just keep his current fans entertained. I think with the right producers and writers, he can really succeed. I don‚Äôt think the label is playing their cards right here.

"Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, I see people comparing these songs to that of like Justin Bieber, but I don‚Äôt remember Justin ever having such explicit songs? As in ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fucking you right‚Äù explicit? It‚Äôs usually more tasteful, innuendos like ‚Äúpeaches‚Äù. And not to mention there‚Äôs a lot to variety with his music (love yourself, ghost of you) and the music of most pop artists. 
Harry Styles‚Äôs music has never come across as immature or boring; it‚Äôs quite artistic and unique. Probably the most popular ‚Äúsexual‚Äù artist right now is Ariana (with songs like positions), and even then at least the melodies and beats make them interesting. 

JK‚Äôs songs so far just feel so sexual for no tasteful reason. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs trying to prove a point. But to me, showing your maturity and sexiness is much better than yelling ‚Äúlook at me, i sing about fucking‚Äù. Pair this with a generic sound and I‚Äôm a disappointed, bored fan. 

People will disagree with me but I just wanted to point out this comparison to top pop artists that I constantly see. People are acting like pop is all boring and all about sex still, but Pop artists nowadays show a lot more vulnerability and soul than even 10 years ago. If the argument is appealing to western pop, why can‚Äôt Jungkook follow that direction? In fact, when looking at Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo, even Taylor Swift who rules the world it seems, it‚Äôs MORE popular and in-style to be emotional and vulnerable now. 

But alas, if this style and lyricism is what makes him happy and fulfilled, then who am I to talk.",0.9748,0.166,0.104,0.729

"After a few listens, I‚Äôve concluded that it could possibly be a grower! Seven had to grow on me so maybe this one will too. I don‚Äôt think Jack‚Äôs verse was that bad tbh, I‚Äôve heard worse and I like their chemistry in the video, pleasantly surprised by it. Pretty sure Latto wasn‚Äôt even in the same room when she appeared in the Seven MV so it‚Äôs nice to see them like actually together and vibing and stuff! 

As for the song, like I said, maybe it‚Äôll grow on me. The beat is definitely catchy as hell, but something about it just sounds‚Ä¶.off. Idk if it‚Äôs the way his vocals have been processed or maybe the vocal delivery he‚Äôs using for this, but Kook sounds really weird on this song. Idk how to even explain it, it‚Äôs almost like his voice is being compressed. He‚Äôs incredibly talented as a vocalist and can BELT and even when he tried to show off a bit at the end it almost sounded muffled?? Like wtf is going on with that?? Probably will have to listen again on streaming because YouTube is infamous for having weird audio processing these days. 

Overall, it‚Äôs not bad! The aesthetics are a lot more playfully sexy than Seven, with the song in turn being more tame as well. Definitely still makes me very curious about how his album will turn out, because this droplet era has been all over the place so far :o",0.9823,0.176,0.075,0.749
